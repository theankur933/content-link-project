        <p>
          Samaira observed the flame flickering in the corner of the house. The
          cluttered two-bedroom apartment in Chennai naver felt like "home." The
          Pale-yellow light from the <i>diya</i> did its final dance and waned
          off, highlighting the finality of her situation. Her finger trembled
          as she signed the papers. They say that life begins at twenty-five,
          but for her, it was the end. The deed was done. She packed her
          suitecases and took only the bare nacessities that were hers.
          Uncertainties lomed ahead, threatening to push her into darkness.
          Unconsciously, she trucked her hair behind her ears. Wearing a simple
          cotton <i>salwar</i> suit, she had no idea how innocent she looked.
          Without thinking, she had chosen a black dress that day. Except for
          the small gold hoops on her ears and a wristwatch, she had left all
          her jwellery behind, as tney were not hers. Beads of sweat dotted her
          forehead. She had to face it; there was no other way. She never wanted
          to see him again for as long as she lived. Walking out with an air of
          finality, she took a local bus to her mom's place. The bus was empty.
          <i>Like my heart and life ...</i> her mind taunted her.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Damn," she cursed herself. Her self-esteem was at an all-time low;
          Ashish had made sure of that. The pathetic part was that she was aware
          of it and yet, had allowed it to happen. Taking a seat next to the
          window, she closed her eyes. Her cheeks were wet. Tears still clung to
          her eyelashes. She had tried her best to make this relationship work
          but it had been a lonely and uphill task---with no help from the other
          side. Theirs was a typical arranged marriage based on a perfect
          horoscope match. Ashish's mother had looked for a fair and slim bride,
          and she had fit the requirements to perfection. Her glossy hair and
          sharp nose enhanced her beauty. The dimples in her cheeks charmed
          everyone. Little had she known that her angelic looks had lured her
          into the trap. After their engagement, thay had chatted and dated. It
          was the sweetest period of her life, and she had fondly imagined
          Ashish as the prince of her dreams. She remembered the times when she
          had slept with the mobile phone sandwitched between her ear and the
          pillow. And she had cherished the heart-shaped pillow he had gifted
          her. Her treasure box was filled with his gift . . . teddy bears,
          mugs, and dried roese. She had cherished those little treasures like
          crazy. Their marriage ceremony was a grand success. Surrounded by
          uncles and aunts, the occasion was filled with fun, frolic and lots of
          food. Of course, her dad had footed the bill for it all.
        </p>

        <p>
          But barely a week after the wedding, everything had changed. The
          honeymoon was over. She saw the other side of him. He had forced her
          to quit her career as an IT professional on the first day of their
          marriage and made sure that she was confined to the kitchen.
          Frustrated, she found her only relief in singing. She had loved rhythm
          and sound even when she was a kid. Her excitement and joy towards her
          passion were brutally killed by him. He had scraped out her feelings
          and mocked her talent. His wrds had hurt her so much that she had
          given up singing. Her heart lingered on that painful day, reminiscing.
          It was dinner time, and her forehead was beaded with sweat. If the
          <i>rotis</i> turned out rough or were not served hot, Ashish would
          throw his plate at her. His mother would then make a big scene acting
          as if he had not eaten for years. Samaira wanted to throw the plate
          back at him, but her innate politeness stopped her.
        </p>

        <p>
          She would never sink that low. However, she made sure that her
          <i>rotis</i> came out soft and served them hot. Engrossed in her task,
          she hummed a melody; she was not aware of it until the voices from the
          dining table reached her."Thinks she is the top singer," mocked
          Ashish."Ha-ha, more of a bathroom singer," her mother-in-law remarked.
          Ashish smirked. "Good-for-nothing." "Her tone is raw, and her rhythm
          is completely out of place. Had my music teacher heard her singing,
          she would have slapped her," his mother said, revealing her singing
          expertise. She cleverly hid the fact that her teacher had chucked her
          out of the class after the first week. "Ask her to stop singing... or
          I will puke," he ridiculed. "I will end up with indigestion," she
          added. Samaira stopped in her tracks. She rushed out of the kitchen
          and ran into the bathroom. These horrible people should never see her
          tears.
        </p>

        <p>
          "She what you have done," his mother wailed. "what?" Ashish demanded.
          "Who will make our <i>rotis</i> now?" she grumbled. Furious, Ashish
          banged on the bathroom door. "Where is our dinner? If you don't come
          out now, your divorce paper will be waiting for you," he yelled.
          Samaira came out quietly. Her face was blank. She had wiped her tears.
          She served the steaming <i>rotis</i> to the selfish people who
          manipulated her. For the sake of her parents, society, and the
          institution of marriage, she had put up with almost everything for the
          past two years, tagging it under the label of "adjustment"
          Neverthless, things never changed; to be precese, her husband . . .
          now ex-husband . . . had never changed. She had thouht that having a
          baby would change him, but that did not happen. Samaira was blamed for
          that. "Barrenland" was the nickname given by her mother-in-law, and
          she had stopped criticising when Samaira fortuitously discovered
          Ashish's reports, which told her otherwise. Though it shocked her, she
          tried her best to stand beside him. She cared more about his health,
          but Ashish did not see it that way. His phychosis grew, and life
          bacame intolerable. He stayed out and did not come home, completely
          drunk, Samaira decided that she had enough and could not take this
          anymore. "I want a divorce." Samaira's voice shivered as she made the
          demand the next morning. Ashish and his mother stared at her. "Is this
          how an Indian girl would talk to her husband?" his mother shrieked.
          "Is this how an indian son would behave after his marriage?" she shot
          back, pointing to the girl who slept peacefully on his bed. "He is a
          <i>man,</i>," justified his mother "Is he?" Samaira scoffed. A dig at
          his manhood, Ashish raished his hand to strike her. She caught it,
          saying, "Enough, Ashish! Hit me and I will drag you to the police
          station for domestic violence."
        </p>

        <p>
          Her sharp voice made him take a step back. She turned to his mother.
          "All I want is a divorce and nothing else. Don't force me to do things
          that I don't want to do." Having never seen that avatar of Samaira,
          her mother-in-law agreed to a mutual divorce, knowing that her son was
          in the wrong. She wanted to hush it up so that Samaira did not drag
          things out in public. Her parents were blissfully unaware of her
          sorrows and Samaira had made sure that it stayed that way. With the
          divorce papers in her hands, all she wanted to do was bury her face in
          her mother's lap and howl like a child. the bus stopped at Anna Nagar.
          The moment she reached her house, Samaira realised that something was
          not quite right. Her uncle Ram and aunt Pariti stood at the door. Ram
          was her father's younger brother. Though they had talked occasionally
          with her over the phone, she had not seen them after her wedding.
          Garlands of roses adorned the entrance. Her neighbours hoveres
          outside. "Samaira, where did you go?" Her uncle rushed to meet her.
          "Uncle..." she fumbled and was lost for words. "We have been trying to
          reach you for more than two hours, but your mobile was switched off."
          "Is something wrong, Uncle?" Samaira demanded. A cold and weird
          feeling took hold of her. Her institution warned that something was
          desperately wrong. "Err . . . " her uncle stammered, raising her
          anxiety. Pariti ran to her and cried, "We have lost your parents and
          your brothers, Samaira. They met with a car accident." She stood
          shocked. Seconds ticked by. There was no response from her. "Samaira."
          Pariti shook her shoulders.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>
            Not my parents...not my brothers...there must have been a
            mistake...</i
          >
          her heart argued. "No, dear," Pariti stressed. Waves of sorrow hit
          her. "Oh my God!" Samaira staggered, unable to digest the fact.
          <i>Are these people playing a prank on me?</i> She did not want to
          believe it. No... no, this was not happening to her. It could not be,
          but everything around her was real, thought it appeared surrel. "How
          could God snatch them away? They had many years left with them," her
          aunt continued miserably, and her wail tugged at Samaira's senses. Her
          family had left her in darkness. No Mamma... no Pappa... and her
          strong brother who had appeared invincible was no more. The truth hit
          her hard. The plug to her consciousness was pulled and just like that,
          Samaira fainted. "Bring her some water," her uncle screamed. "Relax,
          Samaira; you have to stay strong. Thereare certain things that are
          beyond our control," her uncle's voice brought her back to reality
          after a couple of hours. She felt completely drained and just nodded.
          The house was jam-packed with her relatives, and she wanted to shoo
          them away, but she did nothing and felt nothing. Nothing seemed
          tangible and she felt frozen inside. The last rites and formalities
          were done. Sitting in the corner of the house, she did not shed a
          single tear.
        </p>

        <p>
          She imagined that once everyone left, her Mamma and Pappa would walk
          in as usual. Her Mamma would make her favourite office and her Pappa
          would take her for a drive in his car to the beach. She would fight
          with her brother for the front seat. Thay would have fun together, and
          she would build a sandcastle for them. They would all be a happy
          family just as they used to be. "What are you going to do?" her
          uncle's voice broke her reverie. Samaira observed him blankly. "Come
          on, Ram, tell her!" Pariti pushed her husband. "Tell me what?" Samaira
          queried softly. She had received the worst blow of all, and nothing
          could hurt her anymore. "Your mother and father left you debts," her
          uncle informed her with pity. "Which they borrowed for your wedding
          and your brother is no more," reminded her aunt. "You are responsible
          for their debts. I got a call from the bank. You owe them Rs. 30
          Lakhs," Ram told her. "You have an option, Samaira." Pariti's words
          were firm, compelling her to accept the reality. Samaira stained to
          grasp her aunt's words. "Sell the house to us; we will clear the debt
          and deal with the bank; won't we do this for our sweetheart, Ram?" she
          tugged at her husband's shirt. Uncle Ram looked embrarrassed. There
          was guilt written all over his face. Samaira remembered her dad's
          words that their apartment was worth at least Rs. 60 Lakhs. But that
          did not matter now. Monetary banefits meant nothing to her. She nodded
          in acceptance. "Okay, then... we will get the papers ready." Pariti
          pulled her husband onto his feet. She wanted to wind up this deal
          before someone else could sweet-talk Samaira out of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Let us leave the girl in peace. She can clear the rest of the stuff.
          Take your time, darling. You can move out after you sign the papers,"
          Pariti said, sounding magnanimous. "Take care, Samaira." Her uncle
          gently squeezed her hands, reluctant to leave her alone. "I will, she
          confirmed. "Did you hear that?" I know that Samaira is a strong girl.
          Come on, let us go." Her aunt patted her soulder. It was over. Why had
          no one inquired about Ashish? Her mind was baffled as she stared into
          the empty space around her. Did it mean that everyone knew about her
          divorce? She pushed that thought aside. She did not care. The house
          was bare and eerily silent. Reality slowly sank into her. She was
          alone now. No family. No parents. No money and not even a home. She
          was virtually penniless, and vultures surrounded her. She would have
          to talk with her mother... tell her that she had no one... and that
          her aunt was cheating them on their house. She laughed at the irony of
          and lost her composure completely. "Oh God,where has my life gone?
          Where is my Pappa?" "Mom, where are you?" She broke down and flopped
          down on the floor, thumping her fists on the ground. Her cries echoed
          around the empty house. She sobbed miserably. Her teatrs drenched the
          floor. Hours passed. God had not only snatched her parents away but
          had also taken her younger brother with Him.
        </p>

        <p>
          "How dare He!" She punched the floor with her hands again. Bouts of
          hysteria attacked her. Her heart bled as she reminisced over the
          moments with her brother. "You went back on your words, bro. You told
          me that you would get me a new dress with your first month's salary,
          but you left me before you even got it!" her voice broke with a loud
          cry. She screamed. "Why is life so unfair to me?"
          <i>"And why only me?"</i> Had God counted the number of times humans
          had asked him this question, it would have effortlessly surpassed the
          biggest number on Earth---googolplex!
