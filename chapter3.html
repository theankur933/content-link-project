          The desire to survive waned. Completely fed up with her life, Samaira
          cursed the person who saved her.He should have left her to die.How did
          her muddled-up brain imagine him as her brother even for a moment? She
          should have known that her brother would never come back...just like
          her parents. But they were at least together. If not for that man, she
          would have joined them. Her anger doubled. She hit her forehead in
          despair. Not content with taking everything from her, God would not
          even let her die quietly. How pathetic could it get? Self-pity coursed
          through her, and she shivered hysterically. She had kept walking, and
          the office-going crowd now dominated the road. She checked the time.
          It was almost 9:30AM . She had woken up at 4:00AM, considering the
          early <i>mahurat</i> of her cousin's wedding. Traffic was at its peak.
          The red signal halted the vehicles from the other end for more than a
          few minutes. "What happened?" No one knew. <i>"Ma,</i> I'm going to be
          late for school," a little girl complained, seated behind her mother
          on their bike. "Don't worry, darling. I think everyone will be late.
          Ms. Sadana is visiting Chennai today."
        </p>
        <p>
          That explained the rush on the road. Sadana was an influential
          politician from Karnataka. Samaira caught the woman's eye and nodded
          in understanding. the woman responded with a smile. As she walked
          along the pavement, the traffic was the least of Samaira's worries.
          She had other things on her mind. A sharp cry halted her. It was the
          pathetic moan of a woman. Samaira lokked at the crowd, wondering what
          the commotion was all about. A man stepped out of an auto, visibly
          sweating. His taut muscles revealed the tension within him. "How long
          are we ging to stand here?" he demanded the auto driver. "Sir, I think
          it will take some time. Ms. Sadana is crossing this way," the driver
          answered helplessly. "Damn her," he cursed. It might take aeons just
          to get out of the traffic. Bending back into the auto, he reassured
          his wife, "Don't worry, darling we will reach thee hospital soon." The
          pregnant wife sobbed, which pierced the hearts of all the onlookers.
          The auto driver shook his head. It was beyond his control. They were
          stuck in traffic. Her innate thoughtfulness led Samaira to help the
          woman. Two more women joined her. <i>"Anna,</i> don't worry. The
          traffic will clear soon. I'll go and check with the police over
          there," Samaira calmed the husband who looked helpless and frustrated.
          Holding her 9 month tummy, the woman screamed in pain. The baby was
          due any moment now. "Plaese do something," she begged her husband. In
          response, he kicked the road, showing his resentment of the situation.
          The woman Samaira had seen earlier joined them. "Soan, you wait for
          me." She instructed her daughter to wait for her on the pavement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stay calm. I'm a gynaecologist. I can help," she assured the couple.
          "Will you assist me?" She turned to Samaira, who stood next to them.
          understanding the urgency, Samaira readily agreed. They carried the
          woman a little further away on the pavement. where the crowd was
          minimal. Samaira lent her shawl, and the other woman around them
          followed suit. Together, they hastily made a makeshift room, shiesding
          the pregnant woman and the doctor, giving them privacy. The doctor
          brought a medical kit from under the seat of her two-wheeler. "Is she
          all right?" the husband asked coarsely with concern. "Yes, as healthy
          as any of these womwn." The doctor winked. Samaira noticed that the
          wink did wonders to pacify the raging husband. "But, Plaese calm down
          and stay here. I don't want a crowd inside," she instructed, expecting
          to be obeyed without rebuttal. "I'll help you," volunteered Samaira.
          The doctor took her inside the enclosed space that they had created
          fot the labour. Though Samaira's knowledge didn't extend to medicine
          or treatment, there was a rapport between her and the doctor. Her
          temporary job was to follow the doctor's instructions to the dot. "She
          needs help right now," the doctor told her. The expectant mother
          rolled in blinding pain. "Hold still," the doctor told her. "What is
          your name?" Samaira asked the woman. "Radha," the woman mumbled.
          "Relax, Raha, we are here to help you," Samaira reassured the woman,
          who was in no mood to listen. She was in agonising pain. She squeezed
          Samaira's hands as she experienced her next constraction. "We don't
          have much time. Her uterus is dilated. The position is perfect. The
          baby might be out any moment now," the doctor told Samaira after a
          quick examination. She ovserved the mom-to-be, who had calmed down for
          a moment after the last constraction. Radha sweated profusely and was
          as pale as a sheet. Samaira mouthed reassuring words to her, holding
          her hands. The doctor did her job with equipment that Samaira could
          not even name. To top it all, she had a flask of hot water as if she
          was equipped for an emergency birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't look at me like that. That was for my daughter. I didn't plan
          this," she smiled, as she took some water out of it.
          <i>Thank goodness! She is sahe hands, </i>thought Samaira, admiring
          the way the doctor took over this emergency and her memories
          transported her to her pregnant mother. She had been five then. She
          could still recall the sound from the adjoining room at home. Samaira
          had waited with her father outside. The screams had scared har as a
          kid. She was fightened that something had happened to her mom. Her
          grandmother and doctor were with her mother. The little yell from her
          brother had put an end to her mother's cries. She had delivered the
          baby even before they had time to take her to the hospital. It had
          been an emergency birth. There were multiple complications after that,
          which they had not shared with her as she was too broke her reverie.
          Radha's moan broke her reverie. "The next constraction is coming. Be
          prapared," the doctor warned. "Forewarned is Forewarned." "Make sure
          she doesn't flip over in pain," she instructed Samaira. "Now push,"
          she said, turning to Radha. She panted and wriggled to push, without
          any success. "Come on, you can do better than that," urged the doctor.
          Samaira whishpered in Radha's ears, "You can." "Think of your baby...
          you beautiful bunndle of joy. Don't you want to see it soon? Its tiny
          fingers and toes...push harder," the doctor encouraged her. At her
          next contraction, Radha solved the baby with all her might, and they
          all heard the much-awaited tiny cry. "Bravo!" the doctor applauded.
          She cut the cord. "Look at your angel," she prompted Radha, who was
          drained completely. With tears in her eyes, the mother saw her
          daughter in wonder. 30
