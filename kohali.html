        under pressure for India in Sharjah or other places. So I was always
        keen to repeat the same in similar situations. I don't take pressure on
        myself when I am in the middle. I love pressure, and I always believe

        bat. You complicate things, and you are gone.”
        <i class="fa fa-copy"></i>
      </p>
      <p>

        you will have to remember the difference between being rude and being
        confident.” <i class="fa fa-copy"></i>

        hard and not let it go to waste.” <i class="fa fa-copy"></i>
      </p>

        34. “I don't believe in signing anything and everything that comes my
        way. I leave it to my agency to help narrow them down for me, but I do

        and does not corrupt the game.” <i class="fa fa-copy"></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        37. “The one who doesn't or corrupts the game, they are the villain.
        They should be punished, and they have been punished in the past.”
        <i class="fa fa-copy"></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        38. “I wasn't sure of the exact mindset you should have when you go into
        a Test match. So I probably became too defensive when I played my first
        Test match. Short balls in one-day cricket, I have never thought of just
        defending.” <i class="fa fa-copy"></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        39. “Self-belief and hard work will always earn you success.”
