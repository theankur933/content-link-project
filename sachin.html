        with the best in the world. <i class="fa fa-copy"></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        3. At the start of my career, when I used to toss and turn at night, I
        was fighting that feeling and wanting to go to sleep. Now I know that's
        normal, so I'll just get up and watch TV or something. I know it's just
        my subconscious mind getting ready for a game.

        4. I have played for 15 years and it has been a dream.

        6. As a kid I loved John McEnroe. They called me Mac because, while
        everyone else liked Borg, I was crazy about McEnroe. I tried wearing

        10. I feel it's the conscious mind that messes things up. The conscious
        mind is constantly telling you, this might happen or that might happen,
        even before it has happened. Your conscious mind tells you the next ball
        might be a out-swinger, but when it's coming at you you realize it's an
        in-swinger... so literally, you've played two balls.
