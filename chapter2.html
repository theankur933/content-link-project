          Difficulties are for betterment. They stump, twirl, batter, and knock
          us down, but they also polish us, and we begin to sparkle like gems as
          the end of the course.

        <p>
          Samaira stepped into the marriage hall. It was her cousin Sharmi's
          weddind. She was not in the mood to join the occasion, but Sharmi had
          begged her to come. A month had passed after her parents' tragic
          death. Nothing seemmed permanent. She had to hand over the property
          documents to Uncle Ram. They went ahead with the wedding despite her
          parents' death. She did not mind that, but her hearth ached as she
          remembered how her dad had been waiting to see Sharmi all dressed up
          as a bride. A wave of loneliness enveloped her as she walked in. Her
          relatives acknowledged her reluctantly with a half-smile as she strode
          past them. But their hushed voices the moment her back was turned
          caught her attention. She was standing beside a pillar with the papers
          in her hand, deliberating whether to call her aunt, who was busy
          attending to the guests.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was not an accident, "Pooja's voice stopped her. She was their
          neighbour. "Not an accident?" The response was from an unfamiliar
          voice. Samaira assumed that she must be one of her distant relatives.
          She recalled seeing her with her mother a year ago. "Yes, that is what
          they say." "Who are 'they'?" The same question hovered on the tip of
          Samaira's tongue. Pooja ignored the inquiry. "That is not important.
          What matters is, Samaira's parents committed suicide." Her voice
          sounded malicious. Samaira was of stunned. "How do you sat that?" the
          other woman inquired out of curiosity. "Samaira is divorced. Ashish
          didn't attent the death formalities."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What does her divorce have to do with their death?" "Her parents were
          worried thinking of their daughter's life, and her father's
          concentration was never on the road while taking that turn. As a
          result, they went under the truck and her brother paid with his life
          for her sins." Samaira felt suffocated as if a ball was stuck in her
          throat. <i>Was it true?</i> she wondered. She had kept her divorce a
          secret. They would not have known about it. The rational part of her
          brain protested to her heart. "She ditched her husband and killed her
          parents," Pooja declared mercilessly. "Oh my God!" Samaira cried. They
          turned around as they heard her whimper. The other woman had the grace
          to blush, but Pooja said, scornfully, "What is there to cry about? It
          is the truth after all." With those words, she moved away to share her
          gossip with her gossip with her other friends. Had her dad found out
          about her secret? If so, what they said was true. She had killed her
          parents... and inadvertently her brother too.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>How could you?</i> she asked herself. Filled with self-loathing,
          she walked into the restroom. The mirrors mocked her. "She killed her
          parents..." the words taunted her. Is that what the world believed
          about her? If her parents had lost their concentration because of her,
          she would never forgive herself. She shook her head in anguish. Her
          head pounded; holding the iron bar close to the washbasin, she
          attempted to steady herself. Her knees were wobbly. She had to leave
          the place. The papers from her bag fell as she turned away from the
          mirror. She had almost forgotten the reason for her visit--to give her
          uncle the property documents. As she came out of the restroom, her
          uncle saw har. acknowledging her, he moved closer and held her hands.
          "Are you okay, Samaira? Your eyes are red." He looked at her
          sympathetically. "No, I'm okay. The property documents." "Hold on; why
          the hurry?" Just then, the bride waved to her from the
          <i>mandap.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hah, Sharmi wants to meet you. you go to the stage. Say hello to your
          friends. Apply some <i>haldi</i> and come back," he teased her. "Are
          you sure, Uncle?" confirmed Samaira. "Don't you want to do it?" he
          demanded. Her lips curved upward. Sharmi's infections smile caught up
          with her. "May that smile always stay on your lips, " her uncle
          blessed her and patted her shoulders. She went to the other corner of
          the <i>mandap</i> and took some <i>handi.</i> When the crowd gave way,
          she moved near Sharmi and stood opposite her. She didn't notice
          Sharmi's mother-in-law on the other side, with the gossip-loving
          Pooja. When she was about to apply <i>haldi</i> on the bride's cheeks,
          she was stopped." How dare she?" Sharmi's mother-in law-to-be
          screamed. Aunt Pariti rushed to the <i>mandap.</i> Things were getting
          beyond her control.This marriage must happen at any cost. Her
          daughter's future was at stake and this was a wealthy alliance too
          good to miss. "Yes, she is rigth. How could you?" She turned to
          Samaira with her hands on her hips looking angry. Holding Samaira's
          hand, Pariti crushed her fingers, forcing her to drop the
          <i>haldi.</i> Samaira's fingers trembled in pain. "Auntie, I don't get
          it," her voice quivered as she looked at Pariti's angry face. "You are
          a divorcee," she condemned. "At least <i>you</i> have some sense," the
          mother-in-law applauded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you want Sharmi to inherit all your bad luck? Pariti said, fire
          blazing in her eyes. Samaira looked around with embarrassment.
          Everyone's attention was on her. Uncle Ram came to her rescue.
          "Pariti, it was me; I told her to---" "You stop your nnonsense!" she
          burst out. Samaira's heart wept silently. "Don't you want Sharmi to be
          happy?" She grilled Samaira again. "I want her to be happy." "Should
          she end up as divorcee like you?" Pariti's stern voice tore her heart
          in two. "Sorry, Auntie." Samaira tried to cover her monumental
          mistake. Pariti lost her temper. "Cut out the apologies. Just leave
          the stage, Samaira. What you have done is more than enough to wreck
          this show." Modified and trying to control her tears, Samaira ran from
          the stage. The emotional drama kept the crowd entertained, and they
          observed her with interest. Uncle Ram caught her at the entrance. "I'm
          sorry," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Samaira dumped the papers in his hands. Her lips trembled. "I came to
          give you this, Uncle. I will leave." Handing over the papers, she
          left, derejeced. Standing near his broken car the left pavement,
          Vivian silently curse. "How long is this going to take?" he asked his
          driver. "15 minutes, sir." "Damm... I'm going to be late," he swore.
          At 28, he had made it to the top in his career. Punctuality was his
          norm. As the boss of Creative Tanks, he had to be on time for the
          meeting with the managing director of <i>Awzome</i> clothing store. He
          was based at the Banglore corporate office and had come to Chennai to
          finnalise the deal and sign the one-year marketing contract for the
          huge multiple-store outlet. He had started the company from scratch,
          and there was no way he was going to allow it to dwindle away because
          of a flat tyre. His trip could not end in vain. His frustration didn't
          affect his classic good looks. He was dressed formally in a blue
          three-piece suit and polished leather shoes. At 28th years, over six
          feet tall with broad shoulders, he always stood out in a crowd. His
          olivetinted skin and toned muscles were a testament to his regular
          workouts. His broad face and sharp jawline gave him the perfect look
          of a Greek God but with straight black hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shaking his head, he was about to hail an auto when his black eyes
          clashed with dewy brown eyes, glittering with a shade of honey. That
          was the moment Vivian saw her for the first time. She walked on the
          pavement, towards him. His hand stopped in mid-air. But her eyes
          looked beyond him. She had not noticed him at all. Hypnotised, he
          stared at her and his brain rang warning bells to his heart. His
          <i>own</i> angel! Vivian frowned. Now from where did that thought
          come? He had no time for women. They were a distraction. But his heart
          resolutely refused to obey. Samaira didn't know where she was going.
          Her knees ached from tiredness, yet she kept walking. The dizziness
          pushed her off the footpath. Her mind, hearth, and body ached. Her
          soul felt as thought it was ripped from within her. She wanted to pour
          out all the pent-up tears of a lifetime, as she crossed the road. She
          swayed, and her legs faltered. She paushed, holding the lamppost for
          support. Steadying herself, she continued her aimless journey.
          <i>Is she okay?</i> Vivian speculated, staring at her. She walked past
          him. His eyes took in her graceful movements. He breathed in her
          feminine, floral perfume. <i>Plop!</i> Something fell on his right
          hand, and he raised it to examine it. Droplets of tears!
          <i>Why the hell was she crying?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Vivian was annoyed. He hated losers. But hatred was not what he felt
          right now. It was Something else, and he didn't want to put a name to
          that emotion, which took root powerfully in his mind. He wanted to
          hold her, cuddle her, kiss her, and tell that everything was going to
          be alright soon. <i>What is wrong with me?</i> His self-condemnation
          didn't stop his pulsating heart. She was merely a stranger. And he
          would probably naver set eyes again. That tought brought out his
          sourness. Irritated, he turned to the other side. He had an ungent
          business meeting to go to, and he must <i>not</i> entertain
          distraction. That was just what she was. A beautiful distraction.
          "Sir, the car is ready," his driver called out to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good," he acknowledged and opened the door. It was time for him to
          leave. His head turned of its own accord, to get a glimpse of her for
          the last time. She was walking towards the right lane. He had the
          impression that she had no destination in mind. Though she was
          physically present, Vivian was sure that her attention was elsewhere.
          Samaira paushed for a second. Her right ankle hurt. She bent down to
          examine it. A tiny pebble was stuck in her slipper. A wry hovered on
          her lips despite her tears. Balancing hersilf, she strained to get rid
          of the stone with her left hand. She was oblivious to the fact that
          she was in the middle of the road. She had no idea of the monster of a
          yellow lorry cruising towards her, well above the permitted speed
          limit. As she was on the other end of the road, she would not be
          visible to the driver. Vivian's mind alerted him of the impending
          danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Arre...</i>lorry," he warned her in a gruff tone. Though she was
          close enough, she didn't hear him. Shaking his head, he ran towards
          her. There wasn't much time and his only thought was of her safety. It
          was a narrow road, and within a matter of seconds, Vivian covered the
          distance between them. His heart was in his mouth. As he grabbed her
          and pulled her to the other side, they fell togeather, with her
          toppling over him. "Do yo have a death wish?" he demanded. Breathless,
          Samaira didn't reply. She could not comprehend what had happened. The
          road was deserted, except for two people who were in deep conversation
          in the other corner. "Are you oaky?" She raised her head and gazed at
          him but didn't reply. Vivian lost his flow of words and was arrested
          by her hypnotic eyes. The chocolate in them drew him towards her. She
          seemed weightless. Her velvety softness felt like a feather against
          his hard chest. Her brows were perfectly arched, and her mouth was
          full like Cupid's bow. She lifted her hand and brushed off a lock of
          hair from his forehead. <i>What is she doing?</i> His breathing became
          erratic and he found it difficult to control his desire. Her fair face
          was flushed and partly wet. He believed that she was attracted to him
          as well. This was the wild moment he had waited for in his life. And
          that beautiful moment was going to be with this girl. Irrationally, he
          felt somehow connected with her. Her magnetic gaze untied the cords in
          his heart. Her lips trembled, and his heart pounded like a drum. He
          was oblivious to where he was and raished his face towards her. His
          lips longed to meet hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Bro,"she said, and that wild moment crashed around him. It was as if
          someone had poured a bucket if ice-cold water on his heated body, and
          the splash of reality hit him. "You came back." She gently traced her
          fingers along his cheeks. "Please don't ever leave me again, bro.
          Bring Mumma and Pappa with you. I need them. I beg you. I swear that I
          will never fight with you." Vivian was moved. It seemed like she was
          in the midst of an awful tragedy in her life. But this should stop.
          Then she bent down and gathered him close. He gasped. He relised that
          the girl assumed him to be her brother. Grabbing her by her shoulders,
          he shook her hard to bring her back to her senses. But his efforts
          were futile. Her wounded eyes revealed her affection for the brother
          she had lost. There was only one option left to bring her back to the
          living. He didn't think of the repercussions of his action. He pulled
          her close and held her cheeks. Tilting her face, he kissed her hard on
          her lips. His body shuddered at the electrifying heat that coursed
          through his body. Samaira came back to her senses with a jolt of
          shock. She looked at Vivian. "Oh my God!" she cried. "What are you
          doing?" Then she looked at her state and stammered, "What was I
          doing?" Realising she was partly lying on him, she pushed him away.
          Guilt rocked her, and her face baecame red with embarraaament. "I'm
          not your bro, and never will be," Vivian said, wryly. Nothing her
          surroundings, she stood up quickly. She had to leave now. She could
          not stay here a second longer. But his intensely spoken words broke
          her. "Who asked you to be?" she retorted and walked past him. Vivian
          sighed in frustration.
